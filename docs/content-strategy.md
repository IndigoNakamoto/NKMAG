# Content Strategy & Authoring Guide

Welcome, content creators! This guide will walk you through creating and managing articles on the new Nakamotoist platform. Our new system, powered by Payload CMS, is designed to give you more flexibility and power in your storytelling.

## From Ghost to Payload: A New Workflow

Our previous platform, Ghost, used a traditional, single-body editor. Our new platform uses a **block-based editor**. Think of it like building an article with different types of Legosâ€”each block has a specific purpose. This approach allows for richer, more dynamic layouts.

When migrating an article from Ghost, you will recreate it by combining these blocks. A standard blog post will likely be a series of `Rich Text` and `Image` blocks.

## The Content Blocks Palette

Here are the tools at your disposal. Each corresponds to a "block" you can add to an article.

### 1. Rich Text Block
- **What it is**: Your primary tool for writing. It's a full-featured text editor for paragraphs, headings, quotes, lists, and links.
- **When to use it**: For all standard text content. This is the direct replacement for the main editor in Ghost.
- **Example Articles**:
    - "The Fundamentals of Money"
    - "Milton Friedman's Argument Against The Gold Standard"

### 2. Image Block
- **What it is**: A block to upload and place images within your content. It includes a field for an optional caption.
- **When to use it**: For any visual media, charts, or graphics that accompany your text.

### 3. Code Block
- **What it is**: A specialized block for displaying code snippets with proper formatting and syntax highlighting. You can select the programming language.
- **When to use it**: Essential for our technical articles that explain or analyze code.
- **Example Articles**:
    - "SHA256 vs Scrypt: Why Comparing Hash Rates of Different Hashing Algorithms is Misleading"
    - "Scrypt: Harnessing Memory"

### 4. Blockchain Data Block
- **What it is**: Our most unique feature. This block lets you embed live data for specific cryptocurrencies directly into an article. You simply choose a coin (e.g., Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dogecoin) and a display style (e.g., Price Card, Ticker).
- **When to use it**: To provide live, relevant data points within financial or technical analysis. It adds a dynamic element that was not possible in Ghost.
- **Example Articles**:
    - "Why Scrypt Mining is a Smart Diversification Strategy for Cryptocurrency Miners" (could use this to show live LTC/DOGE prices).
    - "@anthonyonchain Ports Ordinals to Litecoin" (could display the live price of Litecoin alongside the article).
    - "Litecoin Halving: Definition, When It Happens..." (could feature a live Litecoin price ticker).

By combining these blocks, we can migrate all existing content and create much more engaging articles in the future.
